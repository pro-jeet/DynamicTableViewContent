# DynamicTableViewContent


This project is an example of loading dynamic data in table from URL and setting cell height dynamically at run time according to the size of image.

Programmatically added UI components (No stroyBoard used)
Alamofire pod used for calling service for data asynchrnously.
SDWebImage pod used for caching and image downloading and rendering.

Followed MVP design pattern to develop the app.

Constraints are set programmatically.

UnitTest class added for ViewPesenter Class.

Proper commenting is done whereever required.

Couldn't give more time because of busy schedule.

Cheerios!!
